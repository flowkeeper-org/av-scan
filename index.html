<h1>Antivirus scaner for Flowkeeper</h1>

<p>There are three things in this repo:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Python script which uploads Flowkeeper EXE files to VirusTotal using its API</li>
  <li>Scan results in JSON format, which are then hosted via GitHub Pages, for flowkeeper.org website to consume:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/vtscan-results-all.json">vtscan-results-all.json</a></li>
      <li><a href="/vtscan-results-warnings.json">vtscan-results-warnings.json</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A GitHub Actions workflow, which runs nightly, downloads the latest Flowkeeper release binaries, and triggers the scan</li>
</ol>
